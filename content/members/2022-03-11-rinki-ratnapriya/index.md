Identification of the causal genes/variants and understanding their roles in human diseases represents the central theme of my research. I have broad background and training in human genetics, genomics and molecular biology. I obtained my masters degree in Genetics at the University of Delhi, India and completed PhD at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India. I did my postdoctoral training at  the National Eye Institute (NEI), NIH, where I exploited next-generation sequencing based, genome-wide methods for understanding the genetic basis of retinal and macular degenerative diseases. Soon, the enormity of this disease and the debilitating impact of blindness on the patient’s physical and mental health became the primary motivation for my research program. I am now an Assistant Professor in the Department of Ophthalmology, Baylor College of Medicine. We are focused on identifying the genes and pathways that are affected in the disease with the aim of understanding the molecular components and the structure of the regulatory apparatus underlying the disease that can lead to novel therapy and improved patient care.
