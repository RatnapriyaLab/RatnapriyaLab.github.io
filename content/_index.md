description: Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the genetic basis of retinal and macular degenerative disease.
---

Welcome to the home page of the laboratory of Dr. Rinki Ratnapriya, Ph.D. in the Department of Ophthalmology at the Baylor College of Medicine, located at the Cullen building on the Texas, Medical Center. Identification of the causal genes/variants and understanding their roles in human diseases represent the central theme of our research. We focus on harnessing the power of genomic technologies to identify the molecular components and the structure of the regulatory apparatus underlying retinal and macular degenerative diseases.



**Our ongoing projects are related to the following:**

1. [Gene expression regulations and their role in AMD](../content/research/2022-03-08-gene-expression-regulations-and-their-role-in-amd/index.md)
2. [Role of rare coding variants in complex disease](../content/research/2022-03-08-role-of-rare-coding-variants-in-complex-disease/index.md)
3. [Genetics architecture  of retinal degenerative diseases](../content/research/2022-03-08-genetics-architecture-of-retinal-degenerative-diseases/index.md)
