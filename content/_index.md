Welcome to the home page of the laboratory of **Dr. Rinki Ratnapriya**, Ph.D. in the Department of Ophthalmology at the Baylor College of Medicine, located at the Cullen building on the Texas, Medical Center.

Identification of the causal genes/variants and understanding their roles in human diseases represent the central theme of our research. Large-scale genomic studies have demonstrated the massive scale of genetic variations among individuals, which have revealed important insights into genetic diversity and disease susceptibility. We focus on harnessing the power of genomic technologies to address translational and clinical bioinformatic challenges pertaining to retinal and macular degenerative diseases. We generate multiple high-throughput functional genomics data sets on the genome, transcriptome and epigenome in disease-relevant tissues/cells and use computational approaches to integrate and analyze this data to identify the molecular components and the structure of the regulatory apparatus underlying the disease.
