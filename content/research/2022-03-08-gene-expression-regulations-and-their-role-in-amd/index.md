Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have established a major role of non-coding variants in Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. However, the biological interpretation of AMD-GWAS findings remains challenging as we have a limited understanding of how associated non-coding variants translate into disease pathogenesis. In recent years, gene expression regulation has emerged as a dominant mechanism for non-coding variants to mediate the disease risk. As a postdoc , I aided functional interpretation of AMD-associated, non-coding variants by performing a large scale, integrative analyses of transcriptome (RNAseq) and their genetic variations from a large cohort (453 individuals) including both controls and cases at distinct stages of AMD. This work has led to generation of a reference for transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in human retina that was missing from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and other large datasets. As next step, we generate and integrate multiple high-throughput functional genomics data sets on the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, in disease-relevant tissues/cells and use computational approaches identify causal variant, disease-associated cis-regulatory regions, target gene, and the disease mechanism underlying a GWAS loci.
