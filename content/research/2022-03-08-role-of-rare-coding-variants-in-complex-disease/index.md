GWAS signals are primarily, common, non-coding variants and identity of the causal gene is not obvious . In a shift from common-disease common-variants (CDCV) hypothesis, the role of rare variants are being recognized in complex diseases. Identification of a rare variants can provide hypothesis-free evidence for causality by pointing to the target gene underlying AMD. Thus, we apply whole exome sequencing to identify the rare variants in AMD and related maculopathies. Our most recent work on the analysis of 63 multiplex AMD families identified rare variants  and target genes at eight AMD loci.
